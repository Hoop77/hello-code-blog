      <description>During my master studies at Technical University of Munich, I attended a practical course where I made two robots grasping a chair in a ROS simulation. Sounds easy, but was a TON of work! I came to the conclusion that even though Gazebo is the first choice simulator in ROS, it is absolutely not ready for doing even the most basic things such as grasping! Although it was quite painful at some points, I really learned A LOT.</description>

      <description>Today, I finally defended my bachelor thesis. It was a brilliant experience since many of my fellow students supported me by taking part at this event today. A big thanks to all of them!
The topic of the thesis was &amp;ldquo;Autonomous Racing with Deep Learning&amp;rdquo;. In the work, I developed a new approach to autonomous racing which hasn&amp;rsquo;t been introduced in literature so far to my knowledge. Furthermore, I strongly focused on giving a formal but comprehensible introduction into deep learning which can be read completely standalone.</description>
