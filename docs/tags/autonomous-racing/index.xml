      <description>Today, I finally defended my bachelor thesis. It was a brilliant experience since many of my fellow students supported me by taking part at this event today. A big thanks to all of them!
The topic of the thesis was &amp;ldquo;Autonomous Racing with Deep Learning&amp;rdquo;. In the work, I developed a new approach to autonomous racing which hasn&amp;rsquo;t been introduced in literature so far to my knowledge. Furthermore, I strongly focused on giving a formal but comprehensible introduction into deep learning which can be read completely standalone.</description>
