In this post I list my personal expectations and goals for  summer semester 2020, studying Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence at TU Munich.

1. Deploying Uply - an easy-to-use Android/iOS App which people can use to find helpers in their neighboorhood, specifically designed for eldery people.

2. Developing a robot perception skill for my practical course "Model-driven approach to robotics perception".

3. Developing a state-of-the-art object detection neural network in the course Computer Vision III.

4. Write blog articles about things I learned.

Moreover, I want to not only strengthen my deep learning skills but also to get familiar with other challenges in robotics such as motion planning and 3D scene understanding.
