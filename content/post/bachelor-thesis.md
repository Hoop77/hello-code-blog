Today, I finally defended my bachelor thesis.
It was a brilliant experience since many of my fellow students supported me by taking part at this event today.
A big thanks to all of them!

The topic of the thesis was "Autonomous Racing with Deep Learning".
In the work, I developed a new approach to autonomous racing which hasn't been introduced in literature so far to my knowledge.
Furthermore, I strongly focused on giving a formal but comprehensible introduction into deep learning which can be read completely standalone.
