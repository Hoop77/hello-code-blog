- wanted to learn reinforcement learning
- connect 4 easy way to start out
- valuable learning resource: Youtube Stanford Lectures CS234
- the course gave a great overview which algorithms work for which types of problems and under which assumptions they converge

- goal: get an agent to learn the game using a RL technique called Temporal Difference learning
- I know that there exists more advanced techniques such as AlphaZero but for the beginning, let's start with the simplest thing we can think of
- The agent is implemented in just a single class
